# Git Workflow Documentation

## Branching Model
- main branch: stable and production-ready code
- feature branches: used for developing new features

## Standard Workflow
1. Create a new feature branch from main
2. Make required changes
3. Commit changes with clear commit messages
4. Merge the feature branch into main
5. Push final code to GitHub

## Purpose
This document reflects a real-world DevOps workflow
used by teams to manage and collaborate on source code.
